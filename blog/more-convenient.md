# Making betterr more convenient

Over time, I've added some features to betterr to make it more convenient. I've done this in three ways:

- Creating an install script. It is creatively named `install.d`. Once you clone the betterr repo, you can add betterr to your project with `rdmd [dir]`, where `[dir]` is your project directory. It copies all source files in such a way that you can compile your project using the `-i` option. It creates a Makefile, adds linking information for `libR`, `libRInside`, and `libopenblas`, and adds the paths/files that are needed for the ImportC functionality. Optionally, you can add the name of your main source file as a second argument. Then you can import whatever you want and compile by typing `make`. A shorter way to say this is that the install script sets everything up so that using it is as convenient as R, Python, or Julia.
- I assume everything is installed. To make *all* functionality of betterr available, you need to have installed R, RInside, and Openblas. I assume it's installed in the install script. In hindsight, I don't know why I was ever hesitant to make an assumption like that.
- Added a `betterr.everything` module. This doesn't include the GSL random number generation or the Gretl matrix library, but all of the R-related stuff is then imported. Since all of those modules are designed to work together, there's no reason not to do this. The effect on compile times is nil.

Some additional changes may come. I might use symlinks rather than copying files. That will keep the project size smaller and automatically update when betterr updates. I may identify `libRInside.so` on compilation. I don't know if that will slow down compilation. I may alternatively have machine-specific compilation holding all the configuration information.

Another thing I've been pondering is giving it the feel of a scripting language. Rather creating a source file with a `main` function, importing the necessary libraries, and starting/closing R, you could create a file such as `source.d` that jumps straight into using betterr. All the boilerplate is added for you when you compile it using `betterr source`. This stuff sounds interesting on paper, but in practice the overhead is very minimal, barely something I notice.
