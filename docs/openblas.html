<h1 id="working-with-openblas">Working With OpenBLAS</h1>
<p>You can check out the example file titled testblas.d to see how you can use OpenBLAS for low-level matrix computations. Note a couple of things, however.</p>
<p><strong>It’s probably not going to speed things up in most cases.</strong> It seems natural to think that using OpenBLAS will lead to better performance for matrix multiplication and other such operations. It will <em>if you’re reusing a matrix/vector</em>. If you already have all vectors and matrices allocated, these functions will be much faster. If you need to allocate a new matrix/vector to hold the result, there’s nothing to gain, since the matrix operations already call into BLAS to do the calculations. The R functions will, in most cases, allocate a new matrix/vector to hold the results. You can avoid that by using BLAS.</p>
<p><strong>Not everything has been demonstrated in that file.</strong> I just showed how to use OpenBLAS. I generally don’t have a need to go this low-level, so I have not created a full library.</p>
