<h1 id="running-programs-in-parallel">Running Programs in Parallel</h1>
<p>The availability of multiprocessor desktop computers has led to the heavy use of parallel programming techniques for numerical work. One downside of embedding R is that libR is not designed to be used from a parallel program. You can forget about using this library with std.parallelism. Your program will crash and burn if you try. One reason is that R uses a global stack to track allocations. If you try to call multiple functions at the same time, and they’re all tracking the same set of allocations, your program will die with a notification that there’s a stack imbalance.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean you can’t use this library in a parallelized program. It just means you have to do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do all the parallel work inside R. If you’re doing only random number generation in parallel, you might be able to do it with an R function that is called from a single D process.</li>
<li>Use std.parallelism on parts that do not require libR. An example would be generating all of the random numbers for a simulation using multiple cores in R, and then taking that data and processing it in parallel using D with std.parallelism.</li>
<li>Using GNU parallel to run multiple D programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is my preferred approach. Since it’s easy to work with multiple random number streams simultaneously, all you need to do is write a D program that takes the stream number as an argument.</p>
<p>An example Makefile line taken from a real-world program is</p>
<pre><code>parallel ./simulation {} $(shell grep &#39;^core id&#39; /proc/cpuinfo |sort -u|wc -l) ::: $(shell seq 1 &quot;$(shell grep &#39;^core id&#39; /proc/cpuinfo |sort -u|wc -l)&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>That’s a bit of a mess, but the ugliness comes from automatic detection of the number of available cores. If I want to hard code it to four cores, I can rewrite that as</p>
<pre><code>parallel ./simulation {} 4 ::: $(shell seq 1 4)</code></pre>
<p>That calls <code>simulation</code> with the first argument set to 4 (the total number of cores) and the second equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4 (this process number). Those numbers are used within my program to set up the parallel RNG and appropriately divide the work.</p>
<p>This is a simple approach to embarrassingly parallel tasks such as simulations.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Here’s a quick example (omitting some imports) to show how you can run a betterr program in parallel that uses R’s built-in parallel random number generator.</p>
<pre><code>import betterr;

void main(string[] args) {
  auto thisProcess = args[1].to!int;
  auto nprocs = args[2].to!int;
  startR();
  
  // This sets the process to the value passed at the command line
  // 500 is the seed, which is then the same for all instances of your
  // program. The seed is 1 if you don&#39;t specify it.
  prngInit(thisProcess, 500);
  long reps = ceiling(1000/nprocs);
  // Do whatever you need to do in your simulation
  // Save the output to a file or do whatever you&#39;d usually do with
  // GNU parallel output.
  closeR();
}</code></pre>
<p>To run this on eight cores, you’d compile it and then run it like this:</p>
<pre><code>parallel ./example {} 8 ::: $(shell seq 1 8)</code></pre>
