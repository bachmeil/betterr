<h1 id="generating-random-numbers-sequentially-and-in-parallel-using-the-gsl">Generating random numbers sequentially and in parallel using the GSL</h1>
<p>Elsewhere I discuss strategies for drawing random numbers at suitable speed using only R. (<a href="random.html">Drawing vectors of random numbers</a>), (<a href="randomscalar.html">taking scalar draws</a>), and (<a href="prng.html">parallel RNG</a>). Those will probably be fast enough for most uses. However, in some cases, you’ll want to be fully efficient. A simulation can take so many draws that you may wish to get rid of the overhead of R altogether by using the GSL for RNG.</p>
<p>ImportC allows D to compile C code, which allows you to call those functions directly from your D program, with no bindings or any other effort. The file gslheaders.c contains the C code needed to call GSL. (You’ll still need to install GSL. On Ubuntu, it’s package libgsl-dev. Maybe in the future we can eliminate the need for the dynamic library, but not yet.)</p>
<p>The file prng.d is a port of parallel RNG code provided by Pierre L’Ecuyer. You can see an example of how it works in the file testgslprng.d. At some point I may add documentation, but there’s not much to add. The GSL functions <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/randist.html">are documented here</a>.</p>
