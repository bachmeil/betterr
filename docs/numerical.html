<h1 id="some-options-for-numerical-computing-in-d">Some Options for Numerical Computing in D</h1>
<p>One of the common criticisms of D is that it does not have the ecosystem to get your work done. In my opinion, that is inaccurate if you want to the type of computing I do, related to statistics and econometrics. This is a discussion of some of the options I’ve used over the years. Yes, it involves calling into C libraries, but that doesn’t seem to surface as a criticism in discussions of Python, R, Julia, Matlab, and basically every statistics program in heavy use.</p>
<p>Calling D from R. Originally, this was what I thought was the approach to take. R is popular. It’s easy to compile D code into a shared library and call it from R. My embedrv2 project makes this really easy by writing the wrapper for you.</p>
<p>Why did I move away from this? There are a couple of reasons. First, if I prefer writing D code, why should I use an approach that’s mostly R with a little D sprinkled in? Second, you’re using D in a very limited sense by merely rewriting bottlenecks for speed. This approach doesn’t do anything to provide numerical libraries for D.</p>
<p>Calling R from D. I actually used this approach first. As in, back in the summer of 2013 when I used D for the first time in a serious capacity, I wrote a program that called into R. Over time I’ve come to the realization that this is the correct approach to take. Dirk was kind enough to add my small C API to RInside. That turns R into a C shared library that can be called by any language that has C interoperability. With a very minimal amount of effort, you suddenly have all of R, both the base language and every package, available to any D program. Any C, C++ or Fortran library with an R interface now has a D interface. Note that these interfaces are efficient - the R interface is actually compiled C code that you call from D. You have database interfaces, you can use all of Tensorflow, there’s Stan for Bayesian inference, and on and on. While I haven’t written convenient wrappers for everything, which will obviously never happen, it’s quite easy to do so yourself. The low-level interoperability is all handled by betterr.</p>
<p>Calling Gretl. This library may not be known outside of economics, but it contains a lot of things that are of interest for data analysis. It’s written in C. One of the more appealing things about Gretl is that it contains an easy-to-use matrix library that sits on top of BLAS and LAPACK. I realeased a package years ago. I’m updating it now, so it’s not currently online. Gretl is a mature, well-tested library that’s been in development for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>Calling the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). This is a well-known library in numerical computing circles. One way I use it is for parallel random number generation. I ported one of Lecuyer’s functions to D, and I ported most of the RNG distributions to D, so I can trivially add PRNG to my programs. This is, of course, an important thing for simulation in 2024, as 32 or more cores on a desktop computer becomes the norm.</p>
<p>Calling Julia from D. I haven’t actually done anything with this, but a while back Symmetry made something available. If there is something I need from Julia I will be able to call Julia from D. I simply have not had a need for it to this point.</p>
<p>dstats. This is a pure D library that was written many years ago by David Simcha. It includes a range of functionality, some of which has made its way into betterr.</p>
<p>Mir. This is an impressive body of work. I can’t say I’ve used it a lot, but I initially had it included in betterr for speedy low-level operations.</p>
<p>BLAS and LAPACK. You can always fall back on these if you need speedy matrix operations. There are D wrappers available on code.dlang.org.</p>
<p>ggplotd. I’ve never used it, but it’s motivated by ggplot and adds plotting capabilities.</p>
<p>scid. I haven’t looked at this recently, but it includes numerical integrationa and differentiation, special functions, linear algebra, and nonlinear equation solvers.</p>
<p>tsv-utils. A little different from the other packages above, but provides tools to work with large text data files. Originally written for use at EBay.</p>
<p>CUDA. I’ve never done anything with this, but there’s a project out there that is claimed to be a very nice way to work with GPUs. That’s all I can say about it. The <a href="https://github.com/libmir/dcompute">repo is here</a> and there were a <a href="https://dlang.org/blog/2017/07/17/dcompute-gpgpu-with-native-d-for-opencl-and-cuda/">couple of articles</a> on <a href="https://dlang.org/blog/2017/10/30/d-compute-running-d-on-the-gpu/">the D blog</a>.</p>
